            ### Brand vs. Generic Medications
            
            **Brand-name medications** are developed and marketed by pharmaceutical companies that initially discover and patent them. 
            These companies have exclusive rights to sell the medication for a certain period, typically 20 years from the patent filing date.
            
            **Generic medications** contain the same active ingredients as brand-name drugs and work the same way in the body. 
            They become available after the patent for the brand-name drug expires. The FDA requires generic drugs to be:
            
            - Bioequivalent to the brand-name version (same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration)
            - Manufactured under the same strict standards
            - Equally safe and effective
            
            **Key differences:**
            
            | Brand-Name | Generic |
            |------------|---------|
            | More expensive | Typically 80-85% less expensive |
            | Protected by patent | Available after patent expiration |
            | Well-known company | Various manufacturers |
            | Marketing costs included in price | Lower marketing costs |
            
            **Why generics are cheaper:**
            - No need to repeat costly clinical trials
            - Multiple companies can produce them, creating competition
            - Lower marketing expenses
            - No need to recover expensive research and development costs

            ### How to Discuss Medication Costs with Your Doctor
            
            Many patients feel uncomfortable discussing medication costs with their healthcare providers, but it's an important conversation to have. Here are some tips:
            
            1. **Be honest about your financial concerns.** Doctors often don't know the cost of medications with your specific insurance.
            
            2. **Ask specifically about generic alternatives.** Use phrasing like: "Is there a generic version of this medication that would work just as well for my condition?"
            
            3. **Bring this report with you.** Having information about specific alternatives can make the conversation more productive.
            
            4. **Ask about medication assistance programs.** Many pharmaceutical companies offer assistance for those who qualify.
            
            5. **Discuss the possibility of a higher dose that can be split** (only with doctor approval and if the medication is safe to split).
            
            6. **Inquire about therapeutic alternatives** in the same drug class that might be less expensive.
            
            7. **Be clear about adherence concerns.** If cost might prevent you from taking your medication as prescribed, your doctor needs to know.

            Dear Healthcare Provider,
            
            I recently received a prescription for {st.session_state.original_medication}. After reviewing my insurance coverage and budget, I'm concerned about the cost of this medication.
            
            I've researched some potential alternatives and would like to discuss if any of these options might be appropriate for my condition:
            
            {', '.join([rec['name'] for rec in st.session_state.recommendations[:3]])}
            
            I understand that my health is the priority, and I'm not requesting any changes that would compromise my treatment. I'm simply hoping to explore options that might be more financially sustainable for me long-term.
            
            Thank you for considering these alternatives.
            
            Sincerely,
            [Your Name]
