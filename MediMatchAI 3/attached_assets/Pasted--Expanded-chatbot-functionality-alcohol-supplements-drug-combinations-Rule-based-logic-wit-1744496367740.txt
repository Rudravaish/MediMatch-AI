🧠 Rule-based logic with keywords + database lookup

🎨 Clean UI formatting for chat responses

✅ Button recheck to ensure nothing breaks

🧪 Testing instructions for full functionality

🧠 Replit AI Agent Prompt — Expand Chatbot + Ensure Everything Still Works
Please expand the Medication Assistant chatbot and double check that everything else in the app still functions properly. This should be done in no more than 3 checkpoints.

✅ 1. Expand Chat Assistant to Handle Advanced Questions
Update the chatbot to handle user questions about:

🥃 A. Mixing medications with alcohol
Trigger words: alcohol, drink, beer, wine

Example: “Can I drink on Zoloft?”

Response: Warn if dangerous interaction exists

🌿 B. Mixing with supplements
Trigger words: turmeric, omega, vitamin, zinc, natural, magnesium

Example: “Can I take turmeric with this?”

Response: Respond with known interaction info or safety tip

💊 C. Combining with other medications
Trigger words: mix, combine, with [drug], interact, conflict

Example: “Can I take Advil and Xanax together?”

Response: Use a small database of known drug conflicts to provide guidance

Use rule-based logic:

Match the user input against keywords + current medication

Lookup from a defined dictionary (or create one inline) with known combos

Add fallback messages if no match is found

✅ Format responses clearly with spacing and optional icons (like ⚠️ or ✅)

✅ 2. Create Example Responses Like:
Zoloft + Alcohol → “Avoid mixing Zoloft with alcohol. It can cause severe drowsiness and increase side effects.”

Turmeric + Diphenhydramine → “No major known issues, but always consult a doctor when using supplements.”

Advil + Xanax → “These are often safe together, but may increase drowsiness. Use caution.”

✅ 3. Add Suggested Questions Under Chat Input
Include clickable suggested questions like:

“Can I drink with this?”

“Is turmeric safe with this?”

“Can I combine this with Advil?”

Clicking one should auto-fill and trigger a response.

✅ 4. Double Check All Other Buttons Still Work
After implementing this feature, please verify that the following buttons are still working and unaffected:

🔁 Find Alternatives → Displays full medication suggestions

🧼 Start Over → Resets all fields and clears output

💬 Ask → Responds correctly to typed questions

📋 Suggested Question Buttons → Populate input and respond automatically

✅ Confirm no conflicts were introduced by expanding the chat logic.

🧪 5. Test With These Realistic Questions:
“Can I drink on Zoloft?”

“Is turmeric okay with Diphenhydramine?”

“What happens if I combine Advil and Xanax?”

“Does Tylenol interact with this?”

“Is it safe to take magnesium?”

✅ Output should be clear, spaced well, and relevant to the medication in context.
